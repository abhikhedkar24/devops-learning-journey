Amazon Web Services – Simple Storage Service (S3)

1️⃣ What is S3?

S3 is:

Object storage service

Highly durable (11 9’s durability – 99.999999999%)

Region-based service

Accessible over HTTP/HTTPS

Unlike EC2 storage, S3 is NOT block storage.

2️⃣ Why S3 is Different from EBS and EFS
Feature	S3	EBS	EFS
Storage Type	Object	Block	File
Attach to EC2?	No	Yes (1 instance at a time)	Yes (multiple)
Access Method	HTTP/HTTPS	Mounted as disk	NFS mount
Scalability	Unlimited	Limited to volume size	Scales automatically
Use Case	Static files, backups, logs	OS, database storage	Shared file system
🔥 Core Difference

EBS → behaves like a hard disk

EFS → behaves like network file system

S3 → stores data as objects inside buckets

3️⃣ How S3 Stores Data

S3 stores:

Object =

Data (file)

Metadata

Unique Key

Structure:

Bucket → Object → Key

There are no “real folders” in S3.
Folders are logical prefixes.

4️⃣ Bucket Rules

Bucket name must be globally unique

No capital letters

No special characters except hyphen

Created inside a region

Once created → region cannot be changed

5️⃣ S3 Architecture

S3 uses distributed architecture:

Data replicated across multiple Availability Zones

High availability

High durability

Fault tolerant

Even if one AZ fails → data still available.

6️⃣ Access Control in S3

By default:
Bucket and objects are private.

Access can be controlled using:

1️⃣ ACL (Access Control List)

Legacy method

Applied at bucket or object level

2️⃣ Bucket Policy (Preferred)

JSON-based policy

Fine-grained permissions

3️⃣ IAM Policy

Identity-based control

7️⃣ Versioning

When versioning is enabled:

Overwriting does NOT delete old file

Instead, creates new version

You can retrieve older versions

Protects against accidental deletion

If you delete object:
Delete marker is created, not actual deletion.

8️⃣ Storage Classes

S3 provides different storage tiers:

Standard (frequent access)

Standard-IA (infrequent access)

One Zone-IA

Glacier (archival)

Glacier Deep Archive

Used to optimize cost.

9️⃣ Lifecycle Management

Automates:

Transition objects between storage classes

Expire/delete objects after X days

Example:
After 30 days → move to Glacier
After 365 days → delete permanently

Used for cost optimization.

🔟 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Replicates objects:

Source bucket → Destination bucket (different region)

Important:

Versioning must be enabled

IAM role required

Replication is asynchronous

Correction to your note:

If you delete object in source,
Replication depends on delete marker replication setting.

Deletion in destination does NOT automatically delete source.

1️⃣1️⃣ S3 Endpoint

S3 is accessed using:

https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com

This is called S3 service endpoint.

1️⃣2️⃣ Static Website Hosting

S3 can host:

Static HTML

CSS

JS

Images

No server required.

You enable:
“Static Website Hosting”

Then bucket becomes publicly accessible (with proper policy).

This avoids:

Creating EC2

Configuring web server

Managing patches

But:
It cannot run backend code.

🔥 Advanced Interview Questions You Must Prepare

Why S3 gives 11 9’s durability?

Difference between durability and availability?

Why S3 cannot be mounted like EBS?

When to use EFS instead of S3?

What happens if two users upload same object name?

Explain eventual consistency in S3.

How do you secure S3 bucket from public access?

🚨 Important Real-World Concepts

You must also know:

S3 is eventually consistent for overwrite operations (older behavior, mostly strong consistency now)

Public access block settings

Pre-signed URL

Server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)
