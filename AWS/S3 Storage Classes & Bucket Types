Amazon S3 Storage Classes & Bucket Types

📌 What I Learned Today

Today I learned how Amazon S3 organizes data using different storage classes based on access frequency and cost optimization. I also understood different types of S3 buckets and how object-level permissions affect public access.

1️⃣ What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service used to store and retrieve unlimited data in the form of objects inside buckets.

Each object contains:

Data

Metadata

Unique key

S3 is globally available, but buckets are created in a specific AWS region.

2️⃣ Why S3 Has Multiple Storage Classes?

The main purpose of storage classes is cost optimization.

Not all data is accessed frequently. AWS divides storage classes based on:

Frequency of access

Storage cost

Retrieval cost

Retrieval time

Availability Zones replication

3️⃣ S3 Storage Classes
🔹 S3 Standard

Used for frequently accessed data

No retrieval cost

Low latency

Stored across ≥ 3 Availability Zones

High availability

Use Case:
Web applications, active content, dynamic websites.

🔹 S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

Lower storage cost than Standard

Retrieval cost applicable

Millisecond retrieval

Multi-AZ storage

Use Case:
Backup data accessed occasionally.

🔹 S3 One Zone-IA

Stored in only 1 Availability Zone

Cheaper than Standard-IA

Retrieval cost applicable

Risk of data loss if AZ fails

Use Case:
Non-critical backup data.

🔹 S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

Rarely accessed data

Instant retrieval

Lower storage cost

Retrieval cost applicable

🔹 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Retrieval time: minutes to hours

Very low storage cost

Used for archival

🔹 S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Lowest storage cost

Retrieval time: 12+ hours

Used for long-term compliance storage

🔹 S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Automatically moves data between tiers

Based on access pattern

Slight monitoring cost

Use Case:
When access pattern is unpredictable.

4️⃣ S3 Bucket Types
🔹 General Purpose Bucket

Most commonly used bucket type

Available in all regions

Supports public or private configuration

ACLs can be enabled or disabled

This is the default bucket type used in most real-world scenarios.

🔹 Directory Bucket

Used for high-performance workloads

Related to S3 Express One Zone

🔹 Table Bucket

Used for structured data workloads

🔹 Vector Bucket

Used for AI/ML vector data storage

Not commonly used in general DevOps scenarios

5️⃣ Practical Performed Today

Created a general-purpose bucket in Ohio region

Uploaded an object

Tried accessing object using public URL

Object was not accessible

Understood that:

Bucket being public does NOT mean object is public

Object ACL must allow public access

Made object public during upload

Successfully accessed object via URL

Attempted to delete bucket

Could not delete because bucket contained objects

Learned that bucket must be empty before deletion

6️⃣ Key Observations

S3 service is global, but bucket is regional

Bucket names must be globally unique

Public bucket ≠ Public object

Cannot delete non-empty bucket

Storage class selection affects cost significantly

7️⃣ Use Case Example

Example scenario:

For an e-commerce company:

Product images → S3 Standard

Monthly backups → Standard-IA

Old financial records → Glacier Deep Archive

Unpredictable access logs → Intelligent-Tiering

8️⃣ What I Understood Conceptually

Storage classes are mainly about balancing cost and access pattern.

If data is accessed frequently → use Standard.
If accessed rarely → use IA or Glacier.
If unsure → use Intelligent-Tiering.

Choosing correct storage class helps reduce cloud costs significantly.
